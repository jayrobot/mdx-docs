Multi Schema migrations address the pain point of having to keep your application code in sync with your database schema by allowing you two active database schemas at once. With Multi Schema migrations, running a migration means being able to preview the new version of your schema alongside the old one. Reading and writing data in both schemas continues to work normally. As a result of having two active schema versions, rollbacks become seamless operations which is particularly useful in the case of an unwanted schema change or backfill.

Multi Schema migrations are supported by default on [Postgres](/docs/postgres) enabled branches (beta) via the UI.

<Alert status="warning">
  Currenlty Multi Schema migrations are only supported via the Migration Editor in the UI. Migrations made via the Table
  View and Schema View will complete automatically.

## Lifecycle

A migration's life cycle consists of `start`, `complete`, and `rollback` steps.

### Start Step

After a migration is started it is considered `active`. During this time, further schema modifications are not possible. This is reflected in disabled buttons and inputs in the UI while a migration is ongoing. From there you can decide whether to `complete` or `rollback` the active migration.

You can view the submitted migration under the Schema History tab while it is `active`.

As more data is added to the table through either the old or the new version of the schema, the ‘other’ column is automatically updated by `pgroll` by the `up` or `down` triggers. Data in each version of the column remains editable.

Migrations that involve more than one operation may result in a temporary additional column in the UI prefixed with `_pgroll_new_`. This frequently occurs with alter column operations that change multiple properties. This column will disappear after the schema migration is completed or rolled back.

### Complete Step

Successfully completed migrations can be viewed under the Schema History tab in the Schema View.

If a migration fails, the submitted migration and failure reason can be viewed under the Migration Errors tab in the Schema View.

### Rollback Step

You can cancel a migration that has not yet been completed by rolling back. This is useful if the backfill or schema changes are unwanted. After a rollback, the schema changes from the migration will not be applied and the new schema will be deleted.
