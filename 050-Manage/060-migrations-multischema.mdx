With Multi Schema migrations you can have two database schemas active at the same time. This allows you to write data to both your new and old schema simultaneously. It also allows you to seamlessly rollback a migration if the resulting backfilling or schema is not to your liking.

Multi Schema migrations are supported by default on Posgres enabled branches (beta) via the UI.

<Alert status="warning">
  Currenlty Multi Schema migrations are only supported via the Migration Editor in the UI. Schema operations made via
  the table view and schema view complete automatically

More information on the input format for the Migration Editor can be found here [pgroll](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll).

## Multi Schema Migration Steps

The following steps only apply to migrations made through the Migration Editor.

A migration's life cycle consists of `start`, `complete`, and `rollback` steps.

### Start Step

After a migration is started it is considered `active`. During this time, further schema modifications are not possible. This is reflected in disabled buttons and inputs in the UI while a migration is ongoing.

You can view the submitted migration in the Schema History tab while it is `active`.

As more data is added to the table through either the old or the new version of the schema, the ‘other’ column is automatically updated by `pgroll` by the `up` or `down` triggers. Data in each version of the column remains editable.

New columns will be showed side by side other columns in an “exploded” view.

- Migrations that involve or require more than one operation may result in a temporary additional column in the UI prefixed with `*pgroll_new_[columnname]*`. This frequently occurs with alter column operations that change multiple fields. This column will disappear after the schema migration is completed or rolledback.

### Complete Step

Successfully completed migrations can be viewed under the Schema History tab in the schema view.

If a migration fails, the log and failure reason can be viewed under the Migration Errors tab in the schema view.

## Rollback Step

You can cancel a migration if you find something wrong with the new schema or backfill. After a rollback, the schema changes from the migration will not be applied.

## Direct SQL Wire Proxy Access

When connecting to your database directly over SQL, you may see up to 3 schemas during a migration. If there is no migration in progress, only 2 schemas will be shown.

There will always be one base schema with all the underlying tables.

There may be a second schema and third schema when a migration is in progress (true?)

If you want to connect to a specific schema, you will need to use search_path parameter. EXAMPLE

## Additional information

- Schema multi-version support is not yet supported with the CLI
