If no traffic is detected for a branch over a 30-day period, either through the REST API or direct [Postgres access](/docs/postgres), Xata will flag the branch as inactive and take appropriate action.
As a result, all search-related operations will be turned off, including [full-text search](/docs/sdk/search), [aggregations](/docs/sdk/aggregate), [vector search](/docs/sdk/vector-search), and [Ask AI](/docs/sdk/ask).
However, other features from the REST API and direct Postgres access will remain available.
To re-enable the search engine, navigate to the branch management section in the corresponding workspace and turn the search engine on for the desired branch.

This action only applies to workspaces on the [Free plan](/docs/concepts/pricing#free-plan).
To avoid this action, please upgrade the workspace to a [Pro plan](/docs/concepts/pricing#pro-plan).
Inactive branches will still count towards the [limits](/pricing) imposed by the [Free plan](/docs/concepts/pricing#free-plan).

Xata will send you a notification via email ten days before taking any action, if no activity continues for a 30 days window in total, Xata will take action on the branch.
Afterwards, you'll receive another email once the branch has been marked as inactive, after the 30-day period.
